# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code 

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code tasks over the years.
These are all done without the use of advanced libraries (`numpy` and the likes): 
I'll try to stay within the Python standard library as much as possible

## Notes:
 - I am aware that I could fetch the inputs directly from the servers, maybe I'll implement that :x:
 - I'll follow the original format of the AoC events: Two tasks a day
